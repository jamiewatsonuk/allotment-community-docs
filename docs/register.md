- **Allotment Site Name** This is the name of your allotment site.  It is used throughout your website and can be changed later.

- **URL** Pick an easily identifiable URL for your allotment community website.  You should make this short, and only use alphanumerical characters (a-z, 0-9) and dashes.  You won't be able to change this later.  For example.  If the allotment site is called "My Allotment Site" you might choose a url of "my-allotment-site" which will mean your website is accessible through https://my-allotment-site.allotment.community.

The rest of the information on this page relates to your own user account which will be created when your website is set up.

You will be redirected to your new website when it has been created.
